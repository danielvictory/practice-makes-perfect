Implement code practice questions with testing to develop development skillz.

I am going to perform a coding challenge daily, whether in leetcode or code wars or what-have-you.  Then!  The real challenge is to include it in my code respository and implement a test for whatever snippet, function, or what-have-you I have completed!

This will most likely start off with only python, but we will move on from there!
